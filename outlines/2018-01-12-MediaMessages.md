# Starting Prompt

To begin our thinking about media in this class we read Marshall McLuhan's "The Medium is the Message" (1964) and Alan Liu's "Imagining the New Media Encounter" (2012), two essays separated by nearly 50 years. What central ideas do McLuhan and Liu share about media, and how does their thinking diverge? After you outline a few points of intersection and rupture between the two, turn your attention to a new medium of your choice from our own historical moment. Choose one idea from either essay that can help you "read" that medium and/or its messages for us.
