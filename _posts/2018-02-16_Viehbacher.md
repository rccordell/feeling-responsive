 <h1> Printing press </h1>
 
 After spending time with the printing press and doing respected readings about the history of the moveable printing press, there is a new appreciation of the texts created during the hand press period.

The printing press is mostly credited to Johannes Gutenberg, a German printer, but his invention can be traced back to Korea during the Goryeo period. This form of having moveable pieces of the printing press revolutionized how mass media was presented to the general population and increased literacy rates across the globe. No longer was printed material restricted to the upper class population but now was introduced to the population across the board. This change starts with Gutenberg. He was mainly focused on printing indulgences, pamphlets, and school books. This allowed for the population to have a wider access to different subjects to their likings.

After spending time in class talking about the history of the printing press and physically interacting with the stamps and numerous parts of the printing press, there is new knowledge that is both haunting and appreciated. Haunting because of the tedious hours that were poured into the physical printing, this is shown in some of the readings in class. We'll first look at the process of printing before looking at more of the negatives of the printing shop.

The process of creating a hand printed document goes as: 

* Placing print type in composing stick
* Composing stick onto a galley 
* Being locked and placed in a printing press to be printed

We were able to experience this process during class. Making sure the 'p' was not actually a 'q' and having it be a tight fit in order to not pie your text was all tedious and time consuming. Understanding the process behind all this made me realize that using the printing press was a beautiful dark twisted process. The images and text created by the printers were done with such accuracy and precision that it created texts that would not be able to be properly reproduced in this modern era. Making sure to have equal pressure on the composing stick was something that proved to be easier said than done. While our class period was done in a controlled environment with no health issues, this was not the case during the early times of the printing press. This was best described in the readings that we had done for class.


As we read in Herman Melville's short story "The Tartarus of Maids", the working conditions in these press shops were below average. The excerpt below showcases one example:


_“To and fro, across the sharp edge, the girls forever dragged long strips of rags, washed white, picked from baskets at one side; thus ripping asunder every seam, and converting the tatters almost into lint. The air swam with the fine, poisonous particles, which from all sides darted, subtilely, as motes in sunbeams, into the lungs. “This is the rag-room,” coughed the boy. “You find it rather stifling here,” coughed I, in answer; “but the girls don’t cough.” “Oh, they are used to it.”” (Melville, 8)_

The harsh words indicate that the working environment during this time period was not regulated and that long hours were worked in this printing shop. This is clearly not a romanticized process by any means, while it is certainly a puzzle piece by the actual placing of the lettering, it was done with agony by the printers devil. 

All of this equates to having a better understanding of the time it took to not only prepare the paper, normally of an animal, but also the process of placing type, printing and bounding a text. There is a certain irony when looking a Gutenberg's life. While he was certainly a major player in the printing press invention, it is not documented well because the technology was just not there.

In a different aspect, there is appreciation that this form of printing was invented as it allows us to study old texts and have a new way of storytelling, away from the previous oral method of telling stories.

Being able to physically interact with all the steps of printing allows us to make connections between the paper maker, compositor, printers devils, and press operators with the books they created. There is an understanding that if something was to be created, there was a direct reason for it to be printed. The process of printing was tedious but the output had great benefits. Gutenberg was able to create a process that institutionalizes language and combine both stamp and textual printing into one. While the atmosphere of the print shop was abysmal, it created something that would be used for generations to come.

Dependent on the quality of paper, ink, and quantity of print material produced, can tell us who the printed material was for. If the parchment was made out of anything besides sheep, calves, or goats, it was most likely meant for the upperclass society. These prints would normally be more expensive and less quantities would be printed. Because of the overall tedious process of printing, mass printing was normally reserved for religious texts, newspapers, currency, and bills of sale; mostly texts that occupied the majority of the printing shop.
