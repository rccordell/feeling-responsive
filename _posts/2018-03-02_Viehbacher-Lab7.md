<h1> Has digital killed the book store? </h1>

Scriptures, novels, textbooks, journals, and other forms of textual literature has always been apart of mankind. Our ability to tell a story has transformed from a visual to orality to textual. We've looked at how the text was tediously placed inside of the composing stick and then the galley, this all provided an intimate way of the process. The goal of this lab is to examine the way we view the physical qualities of a text by using examples from the class activity and then looking at a modern way we read text - online. The main question I would like to tackle is: how has the introduction of online reading applications affected our way of handling a text? Is this for better or worse?

During each of the three stations in the classroom lab activity, we were presented with an array of textual materials. I will talk about the three stations and then have a comparison to the digital aspect that our generation is more used to. I'll start off with station 1.

_Station 1_

As we sat down, we were given numerous German bibliographies. Using the tools at hand: LED flashlight, magnifying glasses, and measuring tape we were able to determine the type of paper and find any watermarks. 

In what was an intimate experience with these texts, we could tell the craft that went into creating these texts. There were two sets of numbers found on the pages, one was the actual page number and the other was to help keep the printer organized and to know where to cut the pages. As we learned in our readings, the difference between an octavo and a quatro was very important to the era. As we saw in "Baxter's Procustes", people were more interested in the physical aesthetic of the book rather than the actual content. While these books did have impressive bindings and the chain-lines were present, they were not useful for transportation because of their size. 

_Station 2_

Moving over towards the _Morse's Geography_, we gained a better understanding of how different editions of the same text could tell us about the society in general. These books were quite different than the ones found in the first station. Thick, leather bound, texts that included a table of contents and pull out maps led us to believe these were in fact school books. 

Having numerous editions printed about the same subject makes us assume that there was a general interest in this subject that made the publishers want to supply the demand. Our group discussed what could be the main reason for these books. We thought that it could be for travel (because it had descriptions of numerous countries around the world) or that it would exclusively be found in the class room. After some debate we understood them to be classroom texts because of the nondescript covers and lack of any pictures of places. 

_Station 3_

The last station was more of a difficult station because of the lack of explanation; although this was the most fun to figure out! The books seemed to be more colorful and more contemporary in relation to the other stations. One thing the group noticed right away was that there were two versions of the spine and the book seemed to be of a sample text. After some consideration, we realized that these were sold door to door as a subscription based program. There was a piece of lined paper in the back where buyers could indicate what type of spine they wanted and how many copies of the text they were going to purchase.

What this tells us about the era was there was a new way for people to purchase texts. Gone was the era of having to explore the book store for a new book and brought in the convenience of not needing to leave your house. The specific types of books that we looked at (note: this was a small sample so I might be making assumptions) were those that seemed to be more of a leisure novel and not one that required too much attention. This reminded me of the romance books that we looked at previously in class and how they were supplied in a similar fashion. 

#### Comparison to modern age

Looking at contemporary texts, I was drawn towards finding one in my IBooks application on my laptop. This is a completely different way of interacting with the text in comparison to the three stations in class. There are no chain marks in the paper, no watermarks, no distinct smell to the pages, nothing physical. What is interesting about reading a text on this, let's say for example, *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee is the way you can interact with the text. The user (different than a reader) is able to change the color of the pages, pinch and zoom to certain sections. You are able to have complete control over how you read the text on the screen. This is where the question begs: is this killing the way we interact with physical books. 

We, just much like the gentleman in the Bodleian Club, are no longer interested in the content of the books but rather how they look on our bookcase. The only thing happening to those books is collecting dust. It's a sad reality that we are facing and it would be interesting to see how printers would react to this societal shift. 

While it is nice that we are able to have thousands of books on a device that weighs less than 1 pound and that we can manipulate the text in a way that best suits us, there is something about the tactile touch of the books. It is almost comforting flipping the pages and placing a book mark to remind us where we are. If anything, this lab has reignited the flame of me wanting to interact with more and more books of all shapes and sizes. However, digital is great in terms of preservation of classical novels and texts. 

The books that we interacted with in class all have had an affect on how we read and deal with textual material. Digital books are just a reflection of our current society; much like how door to door salesmen were representing that time era. It will be interesting to see just how much of an impact digital has on the future of book stores and physical texts.
