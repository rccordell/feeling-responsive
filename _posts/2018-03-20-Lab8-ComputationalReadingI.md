## Fieldbook Prompt

Your fieldbook for coding session 8 should be composed in RStudio, as a new RMD file (`File —> New File —> R New File -> R Markdown`). You should include some of the code you found most interesting/enlightening/infuriating. You can copy and paste from the RMD files we used in class. Make sure you code blocks are separated from your text. They should look like this, but with code in between:

```{r}



```

Perhaps you can even try to tweak some of the code blocks to do new things. You can't break anything. If something goes wrong simply clear the environment (using that broom icon in the `Environment` pane) and start again. If something goes *really* wrong, just copy the text from the lab files on Github and paste it into your RMD file. I and our practicum students are all available to help. 

Remember that when you run this code you're not making permanent changes to the actual data on the websites from which you imported it: you're bringing the data into the R environment where you can experiment and yes, even make mistakes. In your fieldbook, ruminate on the code and its relationship to some of the ideas in our readings, particularly the Padua and Glieck. Start thinking about the relationships among code, writing, and literary analysis.
