# Lab 1
## My reflection on *McLuhan* and *Liu* in relation to Markdown

---

McLuhan can be found in the class zip, and Liu can be found [here] (http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-3-1&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-3-1&brand=9781405148641_brand)

They argue on the benefits and drawbacks ("affordances" and "limitations" respectively) of modern / modernizing technology, particularly that in relation to text

### Markdown Affordances  
1. **Easy blog post writing**  
2. **Can be used with git for basic websites**
	+ see the website I made last semester [here] (https://17f-money.gitlab.io/Wings/)
3. **Allows for a lot of customization with enough knowledge / skill**
4. **Small file size**
5. **Accepts and runs HTML**
	+ Can add custom functionality (for the final product) with JavaScript

### Markdown Limitations   
1. **Large learning curve**
2. **Hard to adjust style**
	+ Can't adjust spacing, font, size, etc. directly in editing
3. **Can't be simply viewed with formatting on a vanilla machine**
	+ For example, if sent to a friend, they would just view the plain-text in notepad
4. **Few direct stylistic choices**
5. **Very difficult to change the style in only parts of the document / final product**
